## Description:

This is a quiz game made to test your knowledge in Javascript. It asks the player questions related to JS and gives four options that you can choose from. A timer of 60 seconds starts counting down when the quiz begins and answering incorrectly results in a penlaty of 10 seconds. Your score is the remaining time after all questions have been answered. The score can then be saved with your name and it will be displayed in the highscore gallery for you to compare with others.
